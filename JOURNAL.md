- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

## March 2nd, 2025
5:58pm: Time to start planning. I have literally no idea where to start or what to do, so I betetr figure that out first.

6:26pm: Finished making a basic sketch:

I realised my orginal thought process wasn't actually possible, but I made design #1, where the tall thingys move back and forth. I haven't seen this on a printer before, it's either the build plate moving (not really possible with the constraints) or the extruder moving two ways (again, not entirely possible, but a fold out thing could be possible but very difficult). I think I will stick with this design for now.

Design #2 just another quick idea to test my brain. This does have a moving build plate (conveyor belt!) but I don't think this is the best idea and it has a good chance of not working.

So far, I'm sticking with design #1.
