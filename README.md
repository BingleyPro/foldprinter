Building a 3D printer... hopefully :D.

This 3D printer has the constraints of having to be foldable and fit inside a briefcase.

Go to the [JOURNAL.md](./JOURNAL.md) to see the progress (note you may need to visit https://infill.hackclub.com/printers/foldprinter/, because images won't render in the journal file on GitHub)
